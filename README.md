 Stanford algorithms specialization through Coursera.

## Notes and TODOs
- Formatting style is based off what I currently use at work in .NET, camel case, capitalized methods, etc. may not be compatible with C++ best practices. 
- Headers, header gaurds, etc. are omitted for brevity. 
- Code up the shortest distance algorithm from week 2 optional videos, closest split pair.
